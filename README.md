Social Network Analysis using graphs as a part of the CS201(DSA) project.


Project Summary
Our project delved into social network analysis, where we explored the intricate world of social networks to gain a deeper understanding of their underlying structures and dynamics. We developed a comprehensive codebase focusing on centrality and network measures, achieving significant outcomes. This included successful data processing and network graph creation, computation of fundamental network metrics, and implementing of Brandes' algorithm to calculate betweenness centrality. We also employed a breadth-first search to find the shortest paths, introduced user sorting and ranking features, and computed vital statistical measures. Throughout this endeavour, we came to appreciate the pivotal role of data analysis in understanding human connections and interactions within social networks. Looking forward, there is exciting potential for further research, including enhancing data visualization and applying machine learning techniques to predict user interactions within the network.


Instructions to implement the code:-


Input:
1.Enter the name of the txt file attached i.e, file.txt
2.In string.h library, the argument type of the function swab is changed from int* to char*


Expected Output:
1.Top 10 users  with highest follow count and follower count.
2.Average number of follows/followers for all users.
3.Median of follows/followers for all users.
4.Top 10 users using Betweenness Centrality Measure


Average Time Complexity of Operations used in the project:


BFS : O(V + E) 
Selection sort: O(n^2) 
Betweenness Centrality: O(V * (V + E))
Here,   n: no of elements
        V: no of vertices
        E:no of Edges
